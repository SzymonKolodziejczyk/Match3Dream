## 🌟 About the Project

**Match 3 Dream** is a prototype of a Match 3 puzzle game. It's currently on hiatus, as I want to develop my other projects, but I plan to return to it someday. The goal is to create a fun and challenging game where players swap tiles to match three or more in a row, triggering combos and earning points. The game is designed with mobile devices in mind, aiming for smooth and intuitive gameplay that is easy to pick up but hard to master.

## 🛠️ Current Features

The prototype currently includes the following core features:

- 🔄 **Swapping and Matching System:** Players can swap adjacent tiles to create matches of three or more.
- 📊 **Grid System:** A dynamic grid that organizes and displays the game board.
- 🏆 **Scoring System:** Tracks player scores based on the number and type of matches made.
- 💥 **Combo System:** Rewards players for consecutive matches and chain reactions.
- 🔄 **Repopulating Grid:** Automatically fills the grid after matches, keeping the game continuous and challenging.
- 🧠 **Match 3 Logic:** Implements the core logic for detecting and processing matches.

## 🚀 Planned Features

To enhance the gameplay experience, I plan to implement the following features:

- 🏠 **Basic Menu:** A simple and intuitive menu system for navigating the game.
- 🎨 **Visual Upgrades:** Improved graphics and animations to make the game more visually appealing.
- ⚡ **Power-ups:** Special items that can be used to clear tiles or create bigger combos.
- 📈 **Upgrades:** Systems for players to upgrade their abilities or unlock new features.
- 💡 **Hints:** A hint system to assist players when they are stuck.
- 🎶 **Audio:** Engaging sound effects and background music to enrich the gameplay experience.
- ⏳ **Time-Based Challenges:** Introduce levels where players must complete objectives within a time limit.
- 🗓️ **Daily Challenges:** Offer players daily tasks or puzzles to keep them coming back.
- 🌍 **Online Leaderboards:** Allow players to compete globally and see how they rank against others.
- 🛠️ **Level Editor:** A tool for players to create and share their own levels.

## 🧑‍💻 Technical Implementation

To create these systems, I've implemented various programming patterns and tools:

- **Singleton:** Ensures that certain classes have only one instance throughout the game, providing a global point of access.
- **Object Pool:** Efficiently manages the creation and reuse of objects to optimize performance.
- **Grid System:** Manages the layout and organization of the game board.
- **Movable Tools:** Implements the logic for moving and swapping tiles on the grid.
